Final Project Report
Project Title

This has resulted in:

Ineffective promotions and offers
Poor product targeting by customer segment
Missed opportunities to improve revenue and reduce cancellations
Objective
As a data analyst, the goal of this project is to help the e-commerce management:

Understand customer spending behavior and segment them
Identify top-performing product categories and revenue contributors
Track loyalty program effectiveness across time
Compare spending patterns of loyalty members vs non-members
Analyze cancellation patterns and optimize fulfillment
Discover actionable insights that improve marketing, retention, and sales decisions
